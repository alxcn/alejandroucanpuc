<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>An industrial engineer is studying a production system with 4 workstations (A, B, C, D) whose outputs depend on shared resources (raw materials, labor hours). The system’s behavior can be modeled using vector spaces, where: <br/>
• Each workstation’s output is a dimension in a vector space. <br/>
• Resource constraints define subspaces of feasible production vectors. <br/>
We want to understand the space of possible output combinations based on the next two constraints: <br/>
1. The outputs of workstation A and B are equal to the outputs C and D. <br/>
2. The output of workstation D needs the same labor as two times the output of workstation A. <br/></p>
<p>Describe the vector space of possible outputs, find a basis and based on the basis describe how the workstations contribute to the overall production system.</p>

<h2>Linear combinations</h2>
<p>From the previous session, we know that for a given vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> every addition of two or more vector is also a vector in <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. We can extend this idea to the addition of multiple vectors scaled by some coefficients.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> be a vector space. A <strong>linear combination</strong> of vectors <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is an expression of the form:
<span class="math display">\[
c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_n v_n
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n\)</span> are scalars (coefficients).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, in the vector space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>, consider the vectors <span class="math inline">\(v_1 = (1, 0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_2 = (0, 1)\)</span>. A linear combination of these vectors could be: <span class="math display">\[3v_1 + 4v_2 = 3(1, 0) + 4(0, 1) = (3, 4).\]</span> In the vector space of matrices <span class="math inline">\(M_{2x2}(\mathbb{R})\)</span>, consider the matrices <span class="math inline">\(A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\)</span>. A linear combination of these matrices could be: <span class="math display">\[2A - B = 2\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; -1 \\ -1 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}.\]</span></p>
<p>One question to arises is: given a set of vectors in a vector space and a target vector, <em>can we express the target vector as a linear combination of the given vectors?</em> The answer is <strong>it depends</strong>, and we will explore this question.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> In the vector space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>, consider the vector <span class="math inline">\(v_1=(1,2,0),\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(v_2=(0,1,1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_3=(-2,0,3)\)</span>. Determine if the vector <span class="math inline">\(u=(1,3,3)\)</span> can be expressed as a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_3\)</span>. If so, find the coefficients.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> We want to find scalars <span class="math inline">\(c_1, c_2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_3\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[u = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + c_3 v_3.\]</span> This leads to the system of linear equations <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*} 1 &amp;= c_1 - 2c_3 \\ 3 &amp;= 2c_1 + c_2 \\ 3 &amp;= c_2 + 3c_3 \end{align*}\]</span> Solving this system, we find that <span class="math inline">\(c_1 = 1, c_2 = 1,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_3 = 0\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> can be expressed as a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_3\)</span> as follows: <span class="math display">\[u = 1v_1 + 1v_2 + 0v_3.\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> In the vector space <span class="math inline">\(P_2(\mathbb{R})\)</span> of all polynomials of degree at most 2, consider the polynomials <span class="math inline">\(p_1(x) = x^2 + 1,\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(p_2(x) = x + 1,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_3(x) = 2x^2 - x.\)</span> Determine if the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(q(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1\)</span> can be expressed as a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(p_1, p_2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_3\)</span>. If so, find the coefficients.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> We want to find scalars <span class="math inline">\(c_1, c_2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_3\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[q(x) = c_1 p_1(x) + c_2 p_2(x) + c_3 p_3(x).\]</span> This leads to the system of equations based on the coefficients of the polynomials: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*} 3 &amp;= c_1 + 2c_3 \\ 2 &amp;= c_2 - c_3 \\ 1 &amp;= c_1 + c_2 \end{align*}\]</span> Solving this system, we find that <span class="math inline">\(c_1 = 1, c_2 = 2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_3 = 1\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> can be expressed as a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(p_1, p_2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_3\)</span> as follows: <span class="math display">\[q(x) = 1p_1(x) + 2p_2(x) + 1p_3(x).\]</span></p>

<div id="generated-spaces" class="section level2">
<h2>Generated Spaces</h2>
<p>Given a list of vectors, <em>can we describe the minimal vector space that contains them?</em> The answer is yes, and this leads us to the concept of generated spaces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Given a set of vectors <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> in a vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, we can consider the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. This set forms a new vector space called the <strong>span</strong> or <strong>generated space</strong> of the original set of vectors and it is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\text{span}(S)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\langle S \rangle\)</span>. Formally, <span class="math display">\[\text{span}(S) = \{ c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_n v_n \mid v_i \in S, c_i \in \mathbb{R}\}.\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, in the vector space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>, consider the vectors <span class="math inline">\(v_1 = (1, 0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_2 = (0, 1)\)</span>. The span of these vectors is the entire vector space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>, since any vector <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> can be expressed as a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[ (x, y) = x(1, 0) + y(0, 1).\]</span> In the vector space of polynomials <span class="math inline">\(P_2(\mathbb{R})\)</span>, consider the polynomials <span class="math inline">\(p_1(x) = x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_2(x) = x\)</span>. The span of these polynomials is the set of all polynomials of degree at most 2 that can be expressed as linear combinations of <span class="math inline">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_2\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[ \text{span}\{p_1, p_2\} = \{ c_1 x^2 + c_2 x \mid c_1, c_2 \in \mathbb{R} \},\]</span> which includes all polynomials of the form <span class="math inline">\(ax^2 + bx\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are real numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> In the vector space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3,\)</span> consider the vectors <span class="math inline">\(v_1=(2,0,0),\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(v_2=(1,3,0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_3=(1,1,0)\)</span>. Describe the span of these vectors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The span of the vectors <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_3\)</span> is the set of all linear combinations of these vectors. Any vector in the span can be expressed as: <span class="math display">\[c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + c_3 v_3 = c_1(2,0,0) + c_2(1,3,0) + c_3(1,1,0) = (2c_1 + c_2 + c_3, 3c_2 + c_3, 0).\]</span> This means that the span of these vectors is the set of all vectors in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> where the third component is zero. Therefore, <span class="math display">\[\text{span}\{v_1, v_2, v_3\} = \{(x,y,0) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{R}\},\]</span> which is a subspace of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>.</p>

<div id="linear-independence-and-dependence" class="section level2">
<h2>Linear Independence and Dependence</h2>
<p>Sometimes a set of vectors can be redundant, meaning that some vectors can be expressed as linear combinations of others. For instance, in the previous example, we can see that <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> can be expressed as a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_3\)</span> as follows: <span class="math display">\[v_1 = 2v_2 - v_3.\]</span> This leads us to the concepts of linear independence and dependence. (Corregir)</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A set of vectors is said to be <strong>linearly independent</strong> if any linear combination of these vectors that equals the zero vector all its coefficients equal to zero. In other words, if the only solution to the equation <span class="math display">\[c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_n v_n = 0\]</span> is <span class="math inline">\(c_1 = c_2 = \ldots = c_n = 0\)</span>, then the set of vectors is linearly independent.
Conversely, if there exists a non-trivial solution (at least one coefficient is non-zero) to the equation above, then the set of vectors is <strong>linearly dependent</strong>.</p>
